# Library Overview

A Python library for interacting with the Nautobot API. 

## Description/Overview

This library dynamically generates objects from the Nautobot API. When a new API endpoint is created by the Nautobot application no significant updates are expected by the pynautobot library.

This library is used heavily by the [Nautobot-Ansible](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-ansible) modules. 


## Audience (User Personas) - Who should use this Library?

**Python Developers**
Python developers that are looking to interact with Nautobot in an object orientated fashion. 

**Network Automators**
Those that are involved with network automation using Python or Ansible. Ansible users will want to be familiar with the library.
