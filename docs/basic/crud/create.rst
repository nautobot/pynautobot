Creating Records
----------------

New Records can be created using a model's :py:meth:`~pynautobot.core.endpoint.Endpoint.create` method.
All fields supported by the Model can be passed into the method, and every required field must be passed.

.. code-block:: python

    nautobot = api(url=url, token=token)
    device_roles = nautobot.dcim.device_roles

    # Create a dict of keyword arguments to use for device role config.
    access_role_config = {
        "name": "Access Switch",
        "slug": "access-switch",
    }

    # Create a new Record in the Device Roles Model.
    access_role = device_roles.create(**access_role_config)

Creating an entry adds a new Record into the Nautobot database,
and a representative :py:class:`~pynautobot.core.response.Record` object is returned.
This record object has attributes for each field in Nautobot.
The following code block is a continuation of the previous one.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # Show that fields passed to the create method
    >>> # are accessible attributes with expected values
    >>> access_role.name
    'Access Switch'
    >>> access_role.slug
    'access-switch'

    >>> # Show that fields not passed to the method
    >>> # were assigned values by the Model
    >>> access_role.description
    ''
    >>> access_role.id
    '6929b68d-8f87-4470-8377-e7fdc933a2bb'
