# Contributing

This section describes how to install *pynautobot* for development, how to run tests, and make sure you are a good contributor.

## Branches

- `main` - Reserved for released code
- `develop` - Planned next release code
- `<feature>` - Individual feature branches, should be based on and PR'd with `develop`

## Python Versions

This leverages Python 3.8 or later.

## Installing dependencies for local development

This repository uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org) for task execution. 

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

```bash
# Double check your version
$ python --version
Python 3.8.7
# Activate the Poetry environment, which will auto create the virtual environment related to the project
$ poetry shell
# Install project dependencies as well as development dependencies
$ poetry install
```

When you install dependencies via Poetry you will get invoke as part of the process.

## Invoke

Python Invoke provides a help context `invoke --list` to help identify possible commands to use. The invoke commands in turn execute the commands necessary to run the linting and unit tests.

## Running tests locally

1. Execute `poetry shell` to enter the virtual environment for the project
2. Execute `poetry install` to install the dependencies
3. Execute `invoke black --local` to execute the black style check
4. Execute `invoke pytest --local` to execute pytest


## Testing

All tests should be located within the `tests/` directory with `tests/unit` for the unit tests. Integration tests should be in the `tests/integration` directory.

### Testing - Required

The following linting tasks are required:

* [Black code style](https://github.com/psf/black)
* [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org)

### Testing Tools coming soon

* [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle/)
* [Yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io)
* [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
  * Black vs Flake conflicts: When conflicts arise between Black and Flake8, Black should win and Flake8 should be configured as such
